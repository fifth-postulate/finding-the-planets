# Observing Position
When a planet orbits a star, they do so around a mutual 
[center of mass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Center_of_mass). Because of this
a star will wobble, i.e. it will appear to change its apparent position.

Similar with direct observation, we could try to observe the wobble of a star
directly. This method faces the same problems, i.e. the distances of the stars
are so immense, the wobble becomes all but undetectable.

So we will quickly move on to other methods.
