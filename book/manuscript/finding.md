# Finding Planets
The following chapters will guide you in writing software that will detects
planets around Trappist-1.

Two things will go hand in hand. Explaining what to do followed by you
implementing that in your favorite programming language.

## Format 
We will chose to adhere to the following format. In almost every chapter we will
output a Comma Separated Values (CSV) file. That file will serve as input for
the next chapter.

Although this could be optimized in a single pipeline, foregoing the need to
write and read CSV, with this format we have to ability to reflect. This will
aid us in understanding our task at hand.

## Outline
The following outline is typical for almost all the activities we are going to
do in this workshop.

1. Read data
2. Process data
3. Write data

Processing could be any of, but not limited to, transforming, filtering,
analyzing or fitting. Now processing will be generating image data.

This could be your first encounter with some of the libraries we use. When we
start using a library for the first time, we are going to be very specific. Once
you get to know the library we leave you to fill in the blanks.

## Further Considerations
Almost every chapter encourages you to play with what you have created. We hope
too give you some food for thought that might spark your interested. But feel
free to come up with your own questions and observations and don't forget to
share them.
