# CSV
Comma Seperated values play an integral role in this workshop. We don't need an
particular sharp tool to process CSV files. Basic reading and writing is more
than enough. We are going to use the `csv` package for this.

Whenever we use the functionality we are going to explain what we are doing. If
you want a head start take a look at the
[documentation](http://csv.adaltas.com/parse/examples/).
