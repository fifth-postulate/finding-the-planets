# Median
We filtered our brightness graph and got something like this.

We would like to know around what kind of average these points are fluctuating.
For that we are calculating the median.

## Calculation
Let's say we have a sequence of values \\(y_{0}, y_{1}, \ldots, y_{n-1}\\). The
median of these numbers is defined as follows.

1. Sort the numbers into a sequence \\(z_{0}, z_{1}, \dots, z_{n-1}\\).
2. From this sorted sequence, pick the middle number. If there is no middle,
   take the average of the middle two.

Lets work out an example. Take a look at the following example

\\[
31, 41, 59, 26, 53, 58, 97, 93, 23, 84
\\]

If we sort this sequence we get

\\[
23, 26, 31, 41, 53, 58, 59, 84, 93, 97
\\]

Because there are an even number of values, we should take the average of the of
the two middle values. The average of \\(53\\) and \\(58\\) is 
\\(\frac{53 + 58}{2} = \frac{111}{2} \approx 55.5\\).

## Make a library.
Because we are going to use the median several times, we are going to create a
library. Let's start with our `lib.rs`.

In our `lib.rs` we are announcing a module called `median`. 

```rust
pub mod median;
```

There are different ways to create this module. Either creating a `median.rs`
file inside the `src` directory. Or creating a `median` directory inside the
`src` directory, which contains a `mod.rs` file. Which every you choose, let's
implement a `median_of` function.

Our `median_of` function will have a `&Vec<f64>` as parameter and return the
median `f64`. Once we have a sorted copy of the data called `copy`, getting the
median comes down to determining if the number of elements is even or odd, and
performing the right calculation.

```rust
let n = data.len();
let middle: usize = n / 2;
let median = if n % 2 == 1 {
    copy[middle]
} else {
    (copy[middle] + copy[middle - 1]) / 2.0;
}
```

But how do we sort the original data? 

### Sorting side-quest
There are a few interesting tidbits when sorting a `Vec<f64>` that we are going
to make a side-quest out of it. While looking into `Vec<T>` 
[documentation](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/vec/struct.Vec.html#method.sort),
you can come across the method `sort`. Let's see if we can use it.

```rust
let mut vs: Vec<f64> = vec!(3.0, 2.0, 1.0);

vs.sort();
```

Unfortunately this doesn't compile.

```text
   Compiling playground v0.0.1 (file:///playground)
error[E0277]: the trait bound `f64: std::cmp::Ord` is not satisfied
 --> src/main.rs:6:4
  |
6 | vs.sort();
  |    ^^^^ the trait `std::cmp::Ord` is not implemented for `f64`

error: aborting due to previous error

error: Could not compile `playground`.

To learn more, run the command again with --verbose.
```

Which could come as a surprise. The `Ord` trait determines an ordering of
elements. Certainly we can determine whether `0.0 < 1.0``? 

```rust
assert!(0.0f64 < 1.0f64);
```

Luckily we can. So what is going on? Rust has two related traits for comparison: 
[`PartialOrd`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/cmp/trait.PartialOrd.html) and
[`Ord`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/cmp/trait.Ord.html). The main difference
is that `Ord` is supposed to be _total_. I.e. any type that implements the `Ord`
trait should be able to compare any pair of values that have the type.

In other words, if you implement the `Ord` trait you should be able to answer
**yes** to one and only one of the following questions with for values `a` and
`b` in the type:

1. Is `a < b`?
2. Is `a == b`?
3. Is `a > b`?

The problem with `f64` is that is implements IEEE-754, the standard for
arithmetic with floating point numbers. This standard defines a value `NaN`,
not a number, which is not comparable with any other value.

So `f64` can not be complete and follow the standard at the same time.
Fortunately `PartialOrd` is implemented for `f64`. So as long as we do not
compare with `NaN`s, which we don't intend to do, we should be safe.

Back to sorting, the `sort` method expects that the `Ord` is implemented, so we
can not use it. `Vec<T>` also has a `sort_by` method, that allows to pass a `compare`
function. We can use this to our advantage by relying on the `PartialOrd` trait.

```rust
let mut vs: Vec<f64> = vec!(3.0, 2.0, 1.0);

vs.sort_by(|a, b| a.partial_cmp(b).unwrap());

println!("{:?}", vs);
```

This correctly sorts our vector. But notice that the `vs` variable is declared
mutable. Our signature doesn't expect to have a mutable reference, so we need to
copy our `data` first.

### Copying Data
We need a mutable copy of our `data`. Luckily the `Vec<T>` API provides an other
method; `copy_from_slice`. We use it as

```rust
let n = data.len();
let mut copy = vec!(0f64; n);
copy.copy_from_slice(&data);
```

This is the final piece in the median puzzle. We are able to put everything
together and write our `median_of` function.

### Form Groups
We do not want to calculate the median of our entire sequence. Instead we want
to move a [*sliding window*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_algorithm)
over our data and calculate the median of that specific window.

For that we need to group our data. Let's create that function.

```rust
fn groups(data: &Vec<f64>, group_size: usize) -> Vec<Vec<f64>> {
    let mut groups: Vec<Vec<f64>> = vec!();

    for end_index in group_size .. data.len() + 1 {
        let mut group: Vec<f64> = vec!();
        for index in (end_index - group_size) .. end_index {
            group.push(data[index])
        }
        groups.push(group)
    }

    groups
}
```

### Median Filter
We are now in the position to create a `median_filter` function. I.e. a function
that calculates the median of a sliding window over our data. With all of our
preparations it writes itself as

```rust
pub fn median_filter(data: &Vec<f64>, window: usize) -> Vec<f64> {
    groups(data, window)
        .iter()
        .map(median_of)
        .collect()
}
```

With our library all done, we can start out processing proper.

## Processing
But wait! Our data arrives as `f64`-pairs, i.e. `(f64, f64)`, and we create
`median_filter` to operate on a single `f64` value. Did I lead you down a wrong
path?

Not entirely. Once again the standard library, in the form of the `Iter` trait,
has a trick up their sleeve. It comes in the pair of methods `zip` and `unzip`.
You can find their signatures below.
With `unzip` you can take a sequences of pairs and return a pair of sequences.
`zip` goes the other way.

Let's see how we can use them. After getting the raw data, we can use `unzip` to
extract the individual components.

```rust
let (times, values): (Vec<f64>, Vec<f64>) = raw
    .iter()
    .cloned()
    .unzip();
```

The `cloned` call is because we need to take ownership of our data. Next we can
use our `median_filter` from our own library. Make sure to reference our own
external crate and import the correct function.

```rust
let median_times = median_filter(&times, window_size);
let median_values = median_filter(&values, window_size);
```

Finally we can zip together these two vectors again to get our result.

```rust
let result = median_times.iter().zip(median_values);
```

Storing this into a CSV file makes it available for the next step.

## Further Considerations
You have created a library that contains some functions. How do you know that
they are implemented correctly? Try to add some
[tests](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/second-edition/ch11-03-test-organization.html)
that increases your confidence in your code.

The `median_filter` accepts an `window_size` argument. What is a good value?

Why haven't we used same the method we used to detrend the data?
