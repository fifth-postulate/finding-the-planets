# Reflection
We just experienced a whirlwind tour of code and science. It is good to reflect on what we did.

We learned that raw data needs to be processed before we actually can use it. Along the way we learned a few tricks how to clean up data. We got to know transit curves and what makes them tick. And we appreciated the difficult task of finding planets.

## Improvements
In this workshop we demonstrated in a very crude way how one can detect planets. The science of exo-planets is a very rich and interesting field. The models they use to routinely scan for planets is far more elaborate.

None-the-less, with our simple understanding gives us a lot of insight into the study of exo-planets.

## Most Important
Most Importantly, I hope you had fun.
