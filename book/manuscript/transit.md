# Transit Method
When a planet moves in between its star and the Earth, it will make the star
appear dimmer because it obscures some of the light rays. Despite planets often
being very much smaller than their companion star, this effect is certainly
measurable.

It is the transit method that we will use in this workshop to detect the planets
around Trappist-1.
