# Doppler Effect
Just like a blaring whistle of a train drops pitch when it rushes by, light
changes color when depending if the light emitter is moving towards us or away
from us. This is called the Doppler effect.

By careful measurement of the Doppler effect in star light one could discover
regularities and infer the existence of planets. Even though this technique is
used to discover exo-planets, we will be making use of a different technique.
