# Exo-planet Discovery
## Direct Observation
One way of discovering exo-planets is by direct observations. You take a
telescope point it in the right direction, this involves a lot of luck, and hope
to spot a planet orbiting around a distant star.

This technique can be used to discover the moons of Jupiter, but because most of
the stars are so far away, it quickly becomes impossible. Instead we should use
our knowledge to infer the existence of exo-planets.

## Indirect Observation
With direct observations out of the window, the alternative is indirect
observation. This entails to take measurements of a star, analyze the data and
infer the existence of exo-planets.

The following sections and chapters will provide some examples of this method.
