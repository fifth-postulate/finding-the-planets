# Showcase
I for one am not fond of spoilers. But I do recognize that you sometimes want to
reflect on your work by looking at the implementation of somebody else. If you
are in the lucky position to attend a workshop at the moment, take the effort to
introduce yourself to your neighbor. They will provide an excellent partner in
your mutual exploration.

If you find yourself working on this one your own, you can find a showcase of
an implementation in the resources. Don't take it as an absolute truth. It is
merely there to show a way to start finding planets.
